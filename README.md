# Giphy

In this assignment I will be calling on Gifs of my favorite super heroes from both Marvel and DC comics.

I will first attempt the basic requirements and then try adding on the capability to add more heroes once I am able to do that

I feel like I panicked a bit last assignment and wasnt able to produce the site that I had wanted too but this week I will be confident and do my best to put my vision into code and onto the screen!

8/21
As i update my portfolio and reflect on my older assignments I want to go back and fix them, 

for this assignment all of my logic works but the styling is bland and does not stand out.

as I use the AJAX call I want to add some sort of loading gif or image to let the user know the app is working even if it is only for half a second
